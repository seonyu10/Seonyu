                    <p class="body2-intro"> After finding out their needs for visually organizing stuff, I came up with an idea that it would be effective to explain BeeCanvas by comparing with Evernote. Evernote was the most well-known note-taking app which offers the opposite UX of BeeCanvas. I wrote <a class="blog" href="https://brunch.co.kr/@seonyu10/29" target="_blank"> an article </a>  about why I began using BeeCanvas as a user not a designer instead of Evernote which I have been using for several years. <br><br>
                    

                    I showed an example of my Evernote which was used for documenting about city branding commercial with my teammates in the article. We gathered various types of media, like youtube videos, web links, pdf files, music files. It was not easily to see and organize all types of media at a glance on Evernote because it is basically note-taking app which is impossible to visually display all the information that I gathered. </p>

                    <h2 class="body3-title">Visually organize ideas with BeeCanvas</h2>
                  
                  
                    <p class="body3-intro"> I explained BeeCanvas is useful in term of creative thinking process. Creative thinking expands in multiple directions, rather than in one direction. I pinpoint that users can gain efficiency and effectiveness by making the process visible on the canvas.
                        <br><br>
                    However on Evernote, users can only type text chornogically and linearlly, which is a process of thought following known step-by-step progression.
                        
I made a point that it was much easier to gather all the scatted ideas from messagaes, notes, emails and all types of files and media. BeeCanvas helps others to 'get inside our heads' in order to convey a thematic setting for a design or to explain function in piece of work. </p>

                    <p class="body8-intro"> People get inpirations from many types of media, which can be  text, pictures, videos, links or music. I pinpoint that there is a moment that people want to bring all the sources and organize them visually without any limitations. For those needs, I suggested that BeeCanvas is the most suitable tool. Based on the user research, I showed actual use cases of BeeCanvas to make potential users see how they can adapt BeeCanvas to their working process.
