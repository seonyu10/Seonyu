                    <p class="body2-intro"> After identifying their needs for visually organizing stuff, I came up with an idea that it would be effective to explain BeeCanvas by comparing with Evernote. Evernote was the most well-known productivity app which offers the opposite UX of BeeCanvas. I wrote <a class="blog" href="https://brunch.co.kr/@seonyu10/29" target="_blank"> an article </a>  about why I began using BeeCanvas as a user not a designer instead of Evernote which I have been using for several years. <br><br>
                    

                    I showed an example of my Evernote which was used for ideations about city branding commercial with my teammates. We gathered various types of media, like youtube videos, web links, pdf files, music files. It was not easily to make connections between things and organize this information at a glance on Evernote.

                    I illustrated the user scenario of what.....
                    Problems that I had on Evernote were solved on BeeCanvas because it was much easier to gather and make connections between all kinds of media together and make comments on the certain objects. <br><br>
                        
                    I explained BeeCanvas is useful in terms of creative thinking process.  Creative thinking expands in multiple directions, rather than in one direction. The painpoint of Evernote is that users can only type text choronologically and linearlly, which makes you less creative.
                        <br><br>
                        
I pinpoint that on BeeCanvas, users can gain efficiency and effectiveness by making the process visible on the canvas, which is impossible on Evernote. BeeCanvas helps others to 'get inside our heads' in order to convey a thematic setting for a design or to explain function in piece of work.</p>
