I redesigned several UI element and made style guide for web and iOS which was for coherent UI style and efficient collaboration with developers.

The box model including margin and padding figure was delivered on Zeplin, which made it really simple for the developer to code without any calculations. The outcome was exactly what I designed.

	•	The icons(Backup, PDF file, Print, slideshow) on second GNB and tool bar icons had been redesigned as well.<br>
	•	The overall tone and manner were designed to match with the brand guide of BeeCanvas.
