                    <p class="body2-intro">To explain easily how BeeCanvas is useful, I needed to compare BeeCanvas with the other services. Evernote was the most well-known note-taking app which offers the opposite UX of BeeCanvas. I wrote <a class="blog" href="https://brunch.co.kr/@seonyu10/29" target="_blank"> an article </a>  about why I began using BeeCanvas instead of Evernote which I have been using for a long time. <br><br>

I showed an example of my Evernote in the article. The Evernote was a reference research documents shared with my teammates, which was used for documenting about city branding commercial. We gathered various types of medias, like youtube videos, web links, pdf files, music file and so on. It was not easily to see and organize all types of media at a glance on Evernote because it is basically note-taking app which is impossible to visually display all the information that I gathered.  </p>

                    <p class="body3-intro"> I explained why BeeCanvas is useful in term of creative thinking process. Human thought characterized by expansion in multiple directions, rather than in one direction, and based on the concept that there are multiple starting points which from many types of information. On Evernote, users think linearly, which is a process of thought following known step-by-step progression.
But on BeeCanvas, it was much easier to make comments on certain objects, which became much more fun when collaborating with teammates. BeeCanvas let us express our ideas more freely and visually on the canvas.   </p>
