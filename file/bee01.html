Working as a product designer, I participated in researching potential users, our competitor and making marketing contents as well. I wrote articles and made commercials for promoting BeeCanvas. Closely communicating with our clients and listening to their needs was helpful to make marketing stratgy and design as well.

BeeCanvas is itself a visual collaboration platform based on an interactive whiteboard, with some similar competitors like realtimeboard, mural, milanote.

I felt this was preferable and more persuasive than contrasting it with similar visual collaboration offerings like Realtimeboard, Mural or Milanote, and highlighting the subtle differences between them. Positioning BeeCanvas as an opposite alternative to Evernote, from the perspective of creative thinking and the management of creative projects, offered a lot of potential scope for viral marketing.</p>

Evernote was the best-known productivity app with a noticeably different user experience to BeeCanvas. I wrote an article explaining what drew me to BeeCanvas as a user. I showed an example from my Evernote which I had collaborated on with my teammates for ideas regarding city branding commercials. We had collated various media files, like youtube videos, web links, pdf files, and music. It had not been easy to make connections between these disparate components and organize everything at a glance on Evernote.

                        <p class="image-des">Sharing ideas and posting documents from the web became much more fun on BeeCanvas and it was easier to make comments on the post-its that the other teammates posted.

                         <p class="body" id="body-strategy02">Using this experience as a basis, I explained how BeeCanvas is useful in terms of the creative thinking process and team-working. This approach to working is an inherently messy, non-linear process and in a traditional note-taking app like Evernote, text, links, and images quickly get heaped in a disorganized jumble, and moving things around with cut and paste is cumbersome. 

<br><br>
                         I highlighted how, unlike with Evernote, BeeCanvas users enjoy greater efficiency by having their process visible on the entire canvas. It helps others involved to 'get into our heads', to illustrate a thematic setting for a design, or to explain function in a piece of work. If someone can put pen to paper and manifest their idea in the moment, the broader group can then form an informed opinion, react, and iterate on the fly. BeeCanvas is, therefore, a free-form note-taking application designed to bring order to the chaos.

                          <p class="body" id="body-strategy">Taglines are succinct catchy phrases that capture a product in one word, and it's a very important factor in marketing. We conveyed the idea that BeeCanvas is a visual collaboration tool like Evernote but beyond there, I wanted to highlight how it helps to boost creativity also. So I suggested the following tagline:
                          
                          </p> <p class="tagline">”We know your ideas are more than just words.”  </p> <p class="body" id="body-strategy"> I also designed the landing page incorporating the phrase, with an image to complement it nicely.</p>
