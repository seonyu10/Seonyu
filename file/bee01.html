Through deep interviews with creative people in various fields, I found some common difficulties when sharing their rough ideas with people and organizing various types of file.

                         <p class="body">I had to investigate existing productivity tools on the market. There are many kinds of collaboration tools, such as file sharing tools, instant messaging tools, cloud storaging tools, and visual collaboration tool. BeeCanvas is a visual collaboration tool based on interactive whiteboard, among other similar competitors: realtimeboard, mural, milanote. Among these many existing collaboration tools, it was important to position where the BeeCanvas was located and how competitive BeeCanvas would be in the market compared to other services.  </p>

Rather than comparing with the similar visual collaboration tool like Realtimeboard, Mural or Milanote and analyze the subtle diffrerences between them, I thought it would be more persuasive to compare BeeCanvas with Evernote. I thought positioning BeeCanvas as the opposite tool of Evernote in term of creative thinking process and managing creative projects would work for viral marketing.</p>

                         <p class="body" id="body-strategy">Evernote was the most well-known productivity app which has the opposite user experience of BeeCanvas. I wrote an article about why I began using BeeCanvas as a user. I showed an example of my Evernote which was used for ideations about city branding commercial with my teammates. We gathered various types of media, like youtube videos, web links, pdf files, music files. It was not easily to make connections between things and organize this information at a glance on Evernote.</p>

                        <p class="image-des">Sharing ideas and posting documents from the web became much more fun on BeeCanvas and it was easier to make comments on the post-its that the other teammates posted.

                         <p class="body" id="body-strategy02">Providing the actual use case of my own, I explained BeeCanvas is useful in terms of creative thinking process and collaboration. Creative thinking is an inherently messy, non-linear process. In a traditional note-taking app like Evernote, text, links, and images quickly wind up a disorganized mess, and moving items around with cut and paste is cumbersome. 
<br><br>
                         I pinpoint that unlike Evernote, users can gain efficiency by making the process visible on the canvas. BeeCanvas helps others to 'get inside our heads' in order to convey a thematic setting for a design or to explain function in piece of work.—if someone can put pen to paper and make an idea tangible in the moment, the group can have an informed opinion, react, and iterate on the fly. BeeCanvas is a free-form note-taking application designed to bring order to the chaos.

                         <h2 class="title" id="title-strategy"> An Eye-catching Tagline </h2>
                          <p class="body" id="body-strategy"> The tagline is a phrase that describes our product in one word, and it was a very important issue in marketing. Comparing Beecanvas to evernote, we conveyed that Beecanvas is a visual collaboration tool. Based on this positioning, I wanted to convey that BeeCanvas helps to boost people's creativity.
                              
                         So I suggested a tagline of BeeCanvas, which is ”We know your ideas are more than just words.” I also designed the landing page with the tagline with the image that supports the tagline well.</p>

Because the way people actually use is different for each purposes, it was very important to provide appropriate examples and use for each target when marketing.</p>
